# Cylindrically Scrolling Text

Simple CSS animation.

CSS supports 3D transformations, but it's not possible to 'bend' a surface.
However, you can fake it by cutting the surface up into segments.
The cylindrical text in this animation is made up of 15 separate segments.

You can see it in action here:
